# Food Delivery App
This is a simple project to show how to implement the server sent event (SSE) connection through a food delivery application. In addition, we also use the observable design pattern.

# How to run?
Run the application (default port is 8080) and open in your browser. Finally, call the /order-food endpoint and follow the results in the browser.
